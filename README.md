## ðŸ¤” What's SLW RK'D?

The world's Slowest Arcadeâ„¢.

### Current Games:

**Block, Paper, Scissors**

Description:

A game of coordination or chaos based around the consensus mechanism of the [FVM](https://fvm.filecoin.io/).

Objective:

- Lead the network to its longest winning streak OR achieve your longest personal combo
  To keep the winning streak going, you are always voting on the next move the network makes and you want it to beat the previous move (eg. If the previous move was Paper, you want the network to play Scissors)
- To keep your personal combo going, you always want to vote with the clear majority. (eg. if 100 accounts participate in a move, and the majority of them chose Paper, your combo continues if you also chose Paper, but ends if you chose Block or Scissors)
- Why would anybody vote against the network streak continuing? I guess weâ€™ll find out. Maybe you want to draw a specific picture on the grid, and that picture canâ€™t be drawn without a bunch of streaks ending or stalemates occuring.

### Currently supported teams(networks):

1. Filecoin Calibration testnet
2. Polygon Mumbai testnet
3. Ethereum Goerli testnet

To participate as a member of a team you will need to add that specific network to your wallet client and obtain some testnet tokens, which will enable you to place votes.

In terms of wallet clients, the path of least resistance will be to install the MetaMask browser extension if you plan to play on desktop. You can install it [here](https://metamask.io/download/).

### To add one or all of the different networks to your wallet client, you can use these links:

- [Filecoin Calibration testnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/314159)
- [Ethereum Goerli testnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/5)
- [Polygon Mumbai](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001)

### To obtain testnet tokens from a faucet for a given team, you can use these links:

- [Filecoin Calibration testnet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/funds.html)
- [Ethereum Goerli testnet](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/). Backup faucet(requires 0.0001 mainnet ETH balance) https://goerlifaucet.com/
- [Polygon Mumbai](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
