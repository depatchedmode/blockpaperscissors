## ðŸ¤” What's SLW RK'D?

The world's Slowest Arcadeâ„¢.

### Current Games:

**Block, Paper, Scissors**

Description:

A game of coordination or chaos based around the consensus mechanism of the [FVM](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). Currently, you will need to connect your wallet client to Filecoin's [Hyperspace Testnet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/testnet-hyperspace)(don't worry, Block, Paper, Scissors will prompt you to connect if you haven't already) then request some `tFIL` from the [faucet](https://hyperspace.yoga/#faucet).

Objective:

- Lead the network to its longest winning streak OR achieve your longest personal combo
  To keep the winning streak going, you are always voting on the next move the network makes and you want it to beat the previous move (eg. If the previous move was Paper, you want the network to play Scissors)
- To keep your personal combo going, you always want to vote with the clear majority. (eg. if 100 accounts participate in a move, and the majority of them chose Paper, your combo continues if you also chose Paper, but ends if you chose Block or Scissors)
- Why would anybody vote against the network streak continuing? I guess weâ€™ll find out. Maybe you want to draw a specific picture on the grid, and that picture canâ€™t be drawn without a bunch of streaks ending or stalemates occuring.
